Our ensemble of superheros (Super Ryan, Super Gabe, Super Anthony, Super Enzo, and Super Breo) was certainly something (although it might have been easy to confuse us with those people who wear tinfoil hats with the amount of tinfoil we were wearing).

So it was not too surprising that his first words were dog commands. \n\nPete told me one day Ryan was out playing in the yard and it was getting close to nap time. Pete stood on the deck and called to Ryan, who immediately ran away. Then he stopped, remembering he had just the words for this scenario, which were to point his tiny finger at his dad and tell him quite firmly, “NO!”  Then Ryan pointed at the grass and told dad, “Down!”  Pete said he couldn’t help but laugh. \nIt’s always been one of my favourite stories.

Jen befriended me on our street corner while she was walking with you and Campy.  She and Campy knew our yard as they would usually walk on the opposite side of the street to avoid Brad's (territorial) Cat - Tiger, but not this lucky day.   I was just recovering from surgery and was walking very slowly by myself pushing a double stroller with Casey and Estelle and we were just at our side door when we started chatting.  The next day the Jen arrived with a Lasagne for us.  How extremely generous and thoughtful.  And from there, as they say, the rest is history.  Your beautiful smile and soul was an easy connection for my two!",
